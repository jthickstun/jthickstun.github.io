I work on machine learning and generative models. I'm interested in methods that control the behavior of models, both from the perspective of a user who hopes to use a model to accomplish concrete tasks, and from the perspective of a model provider or policymaker who hopes to broadly regulate the outputs of a model. I am also interested in applications of generative models that push beyond the standard text and image modalities, including music technologies.

Previously I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University, advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/">Percy Liang</a>. I completed my PhD in the <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu">Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://sham.seas.harvard.edu/">Sham Kakade</a> and <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/">Zaid Harchaoui</a>. I studied Applied Mathematics as an undergraduate at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, advised by <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/echarnia/">Eugene Charniak</a> and <a href="http://bjornsandstede.com/">Bj&ouml;rn Sandstede</a>.

<!--<b>Prospective students:</b> I am recruiting students to join my group starting Fall 2025! Please <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions">apply</a> to the Cornell CS PhD program. I plan to admit multiple PhD students this year interested in generative models, music technologies, or both.-->
