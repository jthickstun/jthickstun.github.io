I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford, advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/">Percy Liang</a>. Previously I completed a doctorate in the <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu">Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://sham.seas.harvard.edu/">Sham Kakade</a> and <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/">Zaid Harchaoui</a>. I completed my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/echarnia/">Eugene Charniak</a> and <a href="http://bjornsandstede.com/">Bj&ouml;rn Sandstede</a>. I work on machine learning, with a current focus on controllable generative modeling. I am also interested in applications of machine learning to artificial intelligence problems in the audio, language, and music domains. My research has been supported by a 2017 NSF graduate fellowship, and a 2020 Qualcomm innovation fellowship.

# I am on the job market this year (2022-2023)! I am broadly interested in academic faculty and industry research positions.

My CV is available <a href="assets/pdf/thickstun_cv.pdf">here</a>.
