title: controllable generation
description: Generative models are powerful tools for revealing structure in data. Features learned by fitting an unsupervised generative modeling objective can be transferred to other tasks. Or, as seen in the source separation project above, we can directly leverage these generative models as priors. The anticipatory music transformer is a controllable generative model of music. Just like ChatGPT generates text, this model is trained to generate music compositions. Unlike most music models, the anticipatory music transformer can infill missing parts of a composition. For example, given a melody, this model can generate an accompaniment to that melody. Previous music transformers generate continuations of music given the past. Our models are designed to also have foreknowledge of the future; we say that they anticipate the parts of the music that are already written. They use this knowledge to infill the rest of the music.

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: project
    description: a project with a background image
    img: /assets/img/12.jpg

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/1.jpg title: "example image" class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/3.jpg title: "example image" class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/5.jpg title: "example image" class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/5.jpg title: "example image" class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/6.jpg title: "example image" class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/11.jpg title: "example image" class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/6.jpg title: "example image" class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/11.jpg title: "example image" class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
